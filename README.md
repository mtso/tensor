## Process
### MNIST example
[MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) is a database of handwritten digits. We will use this data to train our first example of machine learning in tensor. (This tutorial is essentially a clone of [this tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/mnist/beginners) and is created for our js implementation TensorFlow.)

#### Flatten
First, we will transform our data into something that can more easily be processed. In this case, we will transform the image sets into a tensor. 

#### Train
To train our model, we will use [Softmax Regression](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/tutorial/supervised/SoftmaxRegression/). The model will process an image and give probabilities of being each digit (0-9).

Softmax has two steps: adding up evidence of our input being in certain classes, then converting that evidence into probabilities (through a weighted sum).

Evidence can be represented as the sum of the product of weights and their inputs, plus some bias.


#### Test
#### Validate
